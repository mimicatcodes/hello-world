# hello-world

Hello everyone,

I am the Mimicat who codes. I am completely new to this world, but guess what, my passion for coding and programming may exceed yours! I would love to learn so much from all of the talented programmers in this community, and look forward to writing beautiful codes that can possibly change the world!
